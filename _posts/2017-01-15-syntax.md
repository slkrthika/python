if condition:
    print "statement1"
else:
  print "statement 2"

##### else if 
if expression : 
   suite
elif expression : 
   suite 
else : 
   suite
   
##### Multi-Line Statements
total = item_one + \
        item_two + \
        item_three
  
Statements contained within the [], {}, or () brackets do not need to use the line continuation character. For example âˆ’
days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday',
        'Thursday', 'Friday']
        
##### Quotation in Python
Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.

word = 'word'
sentence = "This is a sentence."
paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It is
made up of multiple lines and sentences."""
